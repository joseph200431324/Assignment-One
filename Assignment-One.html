    <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
<p>Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
    I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
    Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
    Wait until the reaper takes my life
    Never gonna get me out alive
    I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)</p>
           <p> Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
            I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
            Face in the mirror is all I need (Ooh-ooh)
            Wait until the reaper takes my life
            Never gonna get me out alive
            I will live a thousand million lives (Ooh-ooh)</p>

            <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
            <p>My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
                Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?</p>

            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            <p>I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
                Where I'm losing all control
                'Cause there's magic in my bones
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                'Cause there's magic in my bones</p>

            <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
            <p>Playin' with a stick of dynamitе
                There was nevеr gray in black and white
                There was never wrong till there was right (Ooh-ooh)
                Feelin' like a boulder hurtlin'
                Seein' all the vultures circlin'
                Burnin' in the flames, I'm workin' in
                Turnin' in a bed, that's darkenin'</p>

            <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
            My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
            Our patience is waning, is this entertaining?

            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
            Where I'm losing all control
            'Cause there's magic in my bones (In my bones)
            I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
            Go ahead and throw your stones
            'Cause there's magic in my bones

            <h3>[Post-Chorus]</h3>
            'Cause there's magic in my bones

            <h3>[Bridge]</h3>
            <p>Look in the mirror of my mind
                Turnin' the pages of my life
                Walkin' the path so many paced a million times
                Drown out the voices in the air
                Leavin' the ones that never cared
                Pickin' the pieces up and buildin' to the sky</p>

            <h3>[Pre-Chorus]</h3>
            <p>My patience is waning, is this entertaining?
                My patience is waning, is this entertaining?</p>

            <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
            <p>I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
                Where I'm losing all control
                'Cause there's magic in my bones (Magic in my bones)
                I-I-I got this feeling in my soul (Soul)
                Go ahead and throw your stones
                'Cause there's magic in my bones</p>
